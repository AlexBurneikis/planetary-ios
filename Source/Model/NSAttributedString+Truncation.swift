/// IMPORTANT!
/// This setting is greatly affected by the length of the string.  In the case of the Home screen,
/// all `Post.text` is truncated via the `PostTruncatedTextCache`.  This is because the measuring
/// that happens in `NSAttributedString.truncating()` is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  And since
/// only a few lines of the post are shown, there is no reason to measure the entire string.  That said, when
/// selecting the `TruncationSettings` for your particular view, be mindful of the actual length of this
/// string.  Using truncated strings will always be faster than using the full string.  In practice on an iPhone 11 Pro,
/// measuring a 3000 character string for display in a table view would cause scrolling to stall.
